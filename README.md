# Mather
A math game loosely based on EarthBound and Mother. The name is a reference to "X-er" from the book <i>Mathematics Education for a New Era</i> by Keith Devlin. The game is still in development. Currently, it only has the character creation screen and a basic map to explore. The game plays on a web browser. The game uses processing.js (http://processingjs.org).
